The Voice Calculator is a Python-based application that enables users to perform mathematical calculations entirely through voice commands. 
It leverages speech recognition to understand natural language input and text-to-speech to read the results aloud. 
This project is ideal for learning about Python programming, speech recognition, and text-to-speech integration.
With this calculator, users can perform basic arithmetic operations like addition, subtarction , division all by simply speaking.
 It provides an interactive and hands-free experience for performing calculations quickly and efficiently.
